# Scientific-Computing-with-Python

I've earned the certification of this course (Scientific Computing with Python). [You can verify it on this page.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/budget-app)

This repository contains my solutions to challenges from the freeCodeCAmp Scientific Computing with Python course that focus on computational problem-solving and basic programming concepts:

1. **Arithmetic Formatter**  
   Created a function to format arithmetic problems vertically for better readability. The function supports addition and subtraction problems, arranges them side-by-side with proper alignment, and optionally displays their solutions. This project involved string manipulation, error handling, and custom formatting to meet user requirements.

2. **Time Calculator**  
   Developed a function to calculate the time after adding a duration to a given start time in 12-hour format. It also accounts for changes in days and optionally identifies the resulting day of the week. This project emphasised working with time calculations and handling various edge cases in string-based inputs.

3. **Budget App**  
   Built a class-based budget management application. Users can create budget categories (e.g., Food, Clothing), deposit and withdraw funds, check balances, transfer money between categories, and print formatted ledgers. This project introduced object-oriented programming concepts, focusing on class design, methods, and encapsulation.

4. **Polygon Area Calculator**  
   Created two classes: `Rectangle` and its subclass `Square`, to calculate various properties such as area, perimeter, and diagonal length. Additionally, implemented methods to determine how many smaller polygons could fit inside a larger one. This project deepened knowledge of object-oriented programming, inheritance, and class-based design.

5. **Probability Calculator**  
   Designed a program to estimate probabilities in experiments with a random draw of coloured balls from a hat. The project included implementing a `Hat` class for representing the balls and their probabilities and an `experiment` function to simulate a large number of draws. This project focused on simulating random processes and using experiments to approximate probabilities.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Built foundational Python programming skills, focusing on both procedural and object-oriented paradigms.  
- Gained experience in handling string manipulation, class design, and probabilistic simulations.  
- Learned to apply computational thinking to solve diverse problems, preparing for more advanced programming challenges.
